⚛ A zoomable, blazing fast, zero dependencies, pure native, typed PDF Renderer for Android and iOS.

It uses [PdfRenderer](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/pdf/PdfRenderer) for Android and [PdfKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pdfkit) for iOS.

## Why another PDF renderer?

The main reason why I create this library is to avoid using third-party native dependencies, like `com.github.TalbotGooday:AndroidPdfViewer`, `com.github.mhiew:android-pdf-viewer`, `react-native-blob-util` or even `react-native-webview`. 

But why?

Every React Native developer knows (or will discover soon) [the pain of updating the React Native ecosystem](https://x.com/flexbox_/status/1806786055057674337) when a new version of Android or iOS comes out, so here we want to avoid this pain as much as possible.

## Requirements

- React Native >= 0.71.0
- iOS >= 12.0
- Android >= API 21

## Install

Install dependency package
```bash
yarn add react-native-pdf-renderer
```
Or
```bash
npm i -S react-native-pdf-renderer
```

Go to the folder **your-project/ios** and run `pod install`, and you're done. 

### Android specific (optional)

Customize the [`androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/recyclerview) version by setting `ext` in your `android/build.gradle` file.

Example:

```gradle
buildscript {
  ext {
    recyclerviewVersion = "1.2.1"
  }
  ...
}
```

## Basic usage

There is only one component that you need to use to render the PDF file.

```jsx
import PdfRendererView from 'react-native-pdf-renderer';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={{flex: 1}}>
      <PdfRendererView
        style={{backgroundColor: 'red'}}
        source="file:///path/to/local/file.pdf"
        distanceBetweenPages={16}
        maxZoom={5}
        onPageChange={(current, total) => {
          console.log(current, total);
        }}
      />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

export default App;
```

The `source` prop must point to a file stored inside the device memory. 

If the file is online, you can use some third-party library like `expo-file-system`, `rn-fetch-blob`, or `react-native-blob-util` to download and save it locally.

For more details, see the [Sample Project](https://github.com/douglasjunior/react-native-pdf-renderer/blob/main/Sample/App.tsx).

## PdfRendererView props

|Name|Type|Default|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|source|`string`||Path to a file stored on the device.|
|distanceBetweenPages|`number`|`16`|Distance in `DPI` between pages.|
|maxZoom|`number`|`5`|Max zoom scale.|
|maxPageResolution|`number`|`2048`|(Android only) Max page resolution (width/height) in pixels when zooming. Defined to prevent Android crash when zooming too much: https://github.com/douglasjunior/react-native-pdf-renderer/issues/26 . |
|singlePage|`boolean`|`false`|Renders only the first page without scroll. (useful for display thumbnail)|
|onPageChange|`(current: number, total: number) => void`||Invoked on pages scroll.|
|onError|`() => void`||Invoked when an error occurs.|
|style|`StyleProp<ViewStyle>`||Styles to be applied to the native [view](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view-style-props).|

## Limitations

### Page interactions

Because Android renders the PDF page as a full image, it does not support text selection, accessibility, or handling links. 

If any of these features are important for your product, we recommend adding a button to open the PDF in an external PDF viewer.

### Size measuring

The `PdfRendererView` is `flex: 1` by default, so you need to make sure that your parents `View`s are `flex: 1` or have a fixed `width/height`.

### Border radius

The `borderRadius` style is ignored by React Native custom view in Android and crashes on iOS. (read more [#1](https://github.com/douglasjunior/react-native-pdf-renderer/issues/1#issuecomment-1483395465))

If you need `borderRadius`, the best option is to wrap the `PdfRendererView` in another `View`.

```jsx
<View style={{ flex: 1, borderRadius: 24, overflow: 'hidden' }}>
  <PdfRendererView
    // ...
  />
</View>
```

### Android crash when zooming too much

To prevent Android from crashing when zooming too much, we have a `maxPageResolution` prop that limits the page resolution when zooming. (read more [#26](https://github.com/douglasjunior/react-native-pdf-renderer/issues/26))

If you are receiving the error `java.lang.RuntimeException: Canvas: trying to draw too large(134806560bytes) bitmap`, try to reduce the `maxPageResolution` prop.

## Mock with jest

```js
jest.mock('react-native-pdf-renderer', () => require('react-native-pdf-renderer/dist/mock'));
```
